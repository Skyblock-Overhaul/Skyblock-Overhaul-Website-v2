                            <li>Context: When patcher 1.5 was in beta and 1.12 crop hitboxes were added, they were
                                bugged and broken. When the SBE developers &quot;made&quot; their version, they somehow
                                managed to produce the exact same bug. Then Moulberry came in and fixed the glitch, and
                                not soon after, the SBE developers also supposedly &quot;found out&quot; how to fix it.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Context: NEU had originally made a feature that allowed you to retexture skulls with
                                custom models. On the SBE discord, they had specifically stated that they will not be
                                stealing features from other mods and people should not request them to add stolen
                                features. At the time Moulberry was pretty annoyed at SBE for blatantly stealing
                                features and was saying on stream he was going to add dungeon puzzle solvers to make SBE
                                useless which was when they put out that statement, but when Moulberry decided against
                                dungeon puzzle solvers, they went straight back to stealing.</li>

                                It is also hard to get help on any other discord server because of SBE&#39;s obfuscation

                <ul>
                    <li>An SBE developer compiled a list of features that Skytils stole from SBE. Here is a rebuttal to
                        a few of the points made.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nearby Burrow Particles</strong> - Addon to Waypoints and is a straightforward feature.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Mythos Trackers</strong>: Many skyblock mods have some sort of item/drop trackers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Display Mythos Loot</strong> - Loot trackers are a common occurence to be found in
                        Skyblock mods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Larger Heads</strong> - Originally made to mimic newer Minecraft version behavior.</li>
                    <li><strong>Big Items</strong> - Originally showcased in Powns&#39; PvP Essential mod a few years
                        ago.</li>
                    <li><strong>Puzzler Solver</strong> - Appeared in NEU 6 days before SBE 2.0 showcase.</li>
                    <li><strong>Show Ghosts</strong> - Appeared in NEU 6 days before SBE 2.0 showcase.</li>
                    <li><strong>Run Overview</strong> - Many mods have this.</li>
                    <li><strong>Score approximation</strong> - Other mods have things similar to this but not as
                        complex.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dungeon Solvers</strong> - Many mods do this.</li>
                    <li><strong>blankblaze.png</strong> - This image is just a white rectangle. Either way, it has been
                        replaced in Skytils with a better solution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prettify Dmg Markings</strong> - Skytils has a custom animation and coloring. Sychic had
                        also started work on it way before Skytils became a thing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hide Dicer Msgs</strong> - Skytils has a whole spam hider feature, hiding many chat
                        messages. Dicer is just one of the things they include.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Hide Fishing Hooks</strong> - Can be seen as an addon to NEU&#39;s fish line colors.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Not to mention, this is missing the point. SBE is a paid mod which breaks EULA and has many
                            downsides. Because of this, free mods will incorporate many features similar to SBE&#39;s.
                            SBE picked it poison when making the mod paid and obfuscated and this is the consequences of
                            that.</p>
                    </li>

                <h1 id="even-if-you-already-bought-sbe-do-not-use-it-">Even if you already bought SBE, do NOT use it!
                </h1>
                <p>If you already did buy it, the Sunk Cost Fallacy makes it so that you still should not use it. The
                    money you spent is already long gone and no longer plays a factor in your decision making. Using the
                    $5 as an excuse to continue using SBE is the irrational decision. Think of it as buying a broken
                    spoon that barely works, and then finding a brand new and perfectly working one in your drawer.
                    There is no reason to continue using the broken spoon. Even if you do use it, you are not getting
                    your money&#39;s worth out of it. That money was thrown away and nothing can be done about it. The
                    same applies for SBE; your money is gone. You may as well remove SBE from your mods folder.</p>
